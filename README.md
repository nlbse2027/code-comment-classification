# NLBSE'27 Tool Competition: Multitask Code Classification

This repository contains the competition dataset, baseline scores, and supporting resources.

Competition website: https://nlbse2027.github.io/tool/

## Competition Overview

Automatically identifying vulnerabilities in modern codebases can help developers detect security issues earlier and improve overall software quality.

Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have opened new possibilities for automated code analysis. 
In particular, Large Language Models have demonstrated good results in understanding and classifying source code. 
However, these models can also be computationally expensive, making **efficiency, execution time, and resource consumption** important considerations for real-world deployment.

This competition explores whether we can build accurate and efficient tools for automated code analysis.
In this challenge, participants are asked to develop **a single ML model capable of performing two independent tasks concurrently**:

1. **Vulnerability Detection** — determine whether a source-code function contains a weakness or vulnerability.
2. **MAT Detection** — determine whether the function is positive for the **MAT annotation,** representing the competition's SATD-related target.

In other words, **one function goes in, and one model produces two predictions**:

```text
                 ┌─> Vulnerability / Weakness
Source Function ─┤
                 └─> MAT / SATD-related label
```

Models will be evaluated on: 
- **predictive performance**
- **Execution time**
- **Computational cost**

All submissions will be evaluated in a common environment to ensure a fair comparison.

## Competition Task

The competition is formulated as a **supervised multi-label classification problem**.
Given a formatted source-code function as input, the model must predict two binary labels:

| Task | Prediction |
|---|---|
| **Weakness/Vulnerability Detection** | Whether the function contains a weakness or vulnerability |
| **MAT Detection** | Whether the function is positive for the MAT annotation |

Participants should therefore develop **one multitask model** capable of learning both classification tasks jointly.

## Dataset

The competition dataset is derived from
[MADE-WIC](https://doi.org/10.1145/3691620.3695348) and combines instances from
the OSPR, Big-Vul, and Devign collections.

The [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLBSE/nlbse27-code-classification) provides two participant-facing splits:

| Hub split | Instances | Labels | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `train` | **214,586** | Available | Model training |
| `test` | **30,655** | Available | Local evaluation and result reporting |


An additional **61,311-instance hidden test split** is retained by the organisers and will be used for the final evaluation and ranking. 

Each observation in the dataset is compose by 4 attribts:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Projectname` | Name of the source project |
| `Filepath` | Original source-file path |
| `Function` | Source-code function after formatting |
| `Label` | Binary vector in `[weakness, MAT]` order |

For the classification tasks, the **`Function`** column contains the source code that should be provided to the model.
The corresponding targets are stored in **`Label`** as a two-dimensional binary vector.
The label order is `[weakness, MAT]`:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[0, 0]` | Neither weakness-positive nor MAT-positive |
| `[1, 0]` | Weakness-positive and not MAT-positive |
| `[0, 1]` | Not weakness-positive and MAT-positive |
| `[1, 1]` | Both weakness-positive and MAT-positive |

Participants do **not** need to train separate classifiers for the two labels, individual projects, or programming languages. 
The objective is to build **one model capable of performing both classification tasks jointly** across the dataset.

## Loading the dataset

Install the Datasets library and load both public splits:

```bash
python -m pip install datasets
```

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("NLBSE/nlbse27-code-classification")
train_dataset = dataset["train"]
test_dataset = dataset["test"]

print(train_dataset)
print(test_dataset)
print(train_dataset[0])
print(train_dataset[0].keys())
```

## Dataset preparation

The dataset was prepared as follows:

1. Combine the OSPR, Big-Vul, and Devign MADE-WIC datasets.
2. Format every function with `clang-format` using the LLVM style.
3. Combine the original `Devign`, `Big-Vul`, and `W` annotations with a Boolean
   OR to obtain the weakness label.
4. Remove functions containing more than 500 `cl100k_base` tokens.
5. Downsample overrepresented joint `[weakness, MAT]` classes to restore the
   distribution that existed before token filtering.
6. Create deterministic, jointly stratified training, public test, and hidden
   test partitions using a 70/10/20 ratio.

## Evaluation

Precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score are calculated independently for the weakness and MAT outputs. 
The primary predictive metric is the mean of the two task-specific F1-scores.

For the final competition ranking, mean F1 contributes 60% of the score.
Average execution time and average GFLOPs each contribute 20%. The organisers
will run every submission on the hidden test split in the same evaluation
environment. The complete scoring procedure is provided in the
competition notebook.

## CodeBERT baseline

The baseline is based on
[`microsoft/codebert-base`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/codebert-base). It
uses a shared CodeBERT encoder and a two-output multi-label classification head.

Validation data is not consulted during fine-tuning. The final trained model is
evaluated once on the complete public test split.

| Output | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Weakness/vulnerability | 0.960 | 0.943 | 0.935 | 0.939 |
| MAT | 0.996 | 0.978 | 0.802 | 0.881 |
| Unweighted average | 0.978 | 0.961 | 0.869 | 0.910 |

The trained baseline is available from the
[NLBSE'27 CodeBERT baseline repository](https://huggingface.co/NLBSE/nlbse27-code-classification-baseline).

## Participation

Participants must train and evaluate one model that predicts both labels. A
submission must include:

- A description of the model architecture and preprocessing;
- The training and tuning procedure;
- Results on the published test split; and
- Open-source code with instructions for reproducing the results.

Detailed rules and executable instructions are provided in competition website [https://nlbse2027.github.io/tool/](https://nlbse2027.github.io/tool/).
